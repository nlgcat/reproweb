# The ReproHum Project
The ReproHum projects aims to define, measure, and improve reproducibility in the field of Natural Language Processing.  The project is funded under [EPSRC grant EP/V05645X/1](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/V05645X/1)

## Survey for NLP researchers
We will shortly be conducting two surveys for NLP researchers.  The first, short survey should take just 5 minutes of your time and will help us to better understand issues around reproducibility in NLP.

## Multi-lab Study
A major part of the ReproHum project is a large multi-lab study where partner labs from across the world will replicate then reproduce results from a variety of prominent NLP tasks.  We are still open to new partner labs joinings:

... what are the reqs?  A faculty memeber to be the primary contact?
... partners provide time, and optionally funding for any experiments they perform (how do we word this?)
